Lightweight CSS Plugin for DokuWiki

Adds an "Editor and better only" script part and removes a lot of
unneeded scripts parts for non editors. It makes the CSS for end users
a lot smaller and faster to load.

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/leightweightcss/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.

## Setup

The __Lightweight CSS Plugin__ filters styles that are for administrative purposes and adds an extra stylesheet for them.

There is a list of configured plugins that are white/blacklisted for certain areas.

Users can customize this list using the `style.ini` of their template by adding a section 

    [lightweightcss]
    
    ; admin style
    lib/plugins/<plugin> = admin

    ; user style include
    lib/plugins/<plugin> = include

    ; user style exclude
    lib/plugins/<plugin> = exclude
